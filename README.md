## What is it
Campfire monitors the internet and informs you about any changes
## How to use

## Index file syntax
I'm too lazy to explain everything thoroughly, so just examine the file and scripts if you like\
__Ceremonies:__
1. `code-check`: watching for http status code to change\
    Props:
    - `url` â€“ site url
2. `class-check`: watching for html class' property to change\
    Props:
    - `url` â€“ site url
    - `status_class` â€“ html class to watch
3. `lookup`: watching if a specific key exists within the website text\
    Props:
    - `url` â€“ site url
    - `key` â€“ needle to look for
4. `osa-lookup` (experimental): looking for keys using AppleScript\
    Props:
